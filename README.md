# Critical-Mass-Coding-Challenge

**Projects that I have worked on**

HappyMapper was a co-created application with a team of developers for the Innovation 4 Health hackathon competition sponsored by The University of Calgary and the Alberta Children's Hospital. Designed and created a video game interface compatible with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to measure Electromyography (EMG) signals to guide rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy.
The roles I took in this project include:
  Project-managed and lead team through planned schedules for deliverables, team meetings and a successful startup product. 
  Planned and designed game, game type, how the game will be run.
  Tested game to see if it was up to team expectations.
  Lead business development in the creation of a business plan, logo designs and performing market analysis.


During the second last semester, my team and I developed scannable AR celebration cards during our artificial intellegence class. Users would send a physical card with a scannable QR code. Once scanned, an interactable 3D model would appear on the front of the card and a homemade video would appear on the other side of the card.
The roles I took in this project include:
  Co-designed the idea, working through iteration of planning
  Co-developing the card so that it worked properly
  

Another project I worked on developed my interest in developing as well as learning about HCI. While small, this project helped us create our own portfolios as well as build projects for clients. The client requested that we create a video calling web project where the users can interact with each other. This was for the clients 1 year old child and the grandparents. With this request, I created an video calling project where both the users can interact and flip through books together. The child would have fun flipping the book pages while listening to the story read from the other user.
The role I took in this project:
  I planned, designed the idea as well as developed the application

**Inspiration**

1. One project: I find the term smart cities very interesting from a technical standpoint. While this is not a single work it is a group of projects that create a constant technical environment that will allow more people to live in cities and grow further. In the future, more and more people will move to city life, but the issue is that there is not enough resources such as water and electricity to support an ever growing population. Some projects include smart driving cars or the use of smart lens hwere they make life easier and safer to live. 
2. The second project I find very inspiring are video games. While playing games I enjoy they inspire me to build something that people would love and enjoy using. It is very mind blowing that a whole team can work together to create such a huge project. When imaging the breakdown of the aspects that have to be programmed is very inspiring. 
3. The third project that I find interesting and inspiring are translation applications. These applications and devices will listen to what language is speaking and translate it to another language for people from different places can communicate. I love being able to use both my degrees in computer science and languages in such ways. It would be my goal to work with my passions to help someone else. 

**Focus**

If I was given the time to build or learn anything I would like to learn and explore all of my interests and learning how to be a better developer. I would choose one main project I would like to focus on such as in developing an app, building some type of game or even exploring VR and AR realms. I would learn how to develop, but also look at this project that I am working on in a business standpoint and see if how project would be used, and if it was sellable in a marketing standpoint.
